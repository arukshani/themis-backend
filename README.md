## Classification

To classify the congestion control algorithm of a website, run `python3.6 classify_websites.py --website [website] [file url]`. The predicted label for the website and the names of the final experiments used in the prediction will be printed and saved to `/tmp/data-processed/[website]-[year][month][day].results`.
